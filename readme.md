In 2011 I found the gcc building blocks did not match the source code, so I switched to using Understand from Scitools.

We modified the graphics package so that we could get the source code adjacency matrix and then use Floyd-Warshall to get the path coverage data.

Now clang and its Ada variant, Libadalang from AdaCore, provide a lexer stream.

I am revisiting gcc dumptree flags to see if I can use it as steps on the way to mccabe & halstead metrics, and path coverage / data flow data generation.
